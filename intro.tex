\chapter{Introduction}

There may be some chemistry curricula that include a course on statistics as a requirement. In my undergraduate and graduate programs at two different public institutions there was no such requirement. My undergraduate curriculum required three semesters of calculus, however, and in my career as an industrial chemist I can think of only one circumstance that it proved useful.

In contrast, within a few months of employment in my first job as a chemist working for a paint company I learned about experiment design. I was very fortunate.  I had two terrific mentors, John Lofstrom and Ken Hesler at DeSoto, Inc. in the early 1980's, who showed me the tools that would prove more useful than any other in doing experimental work. My hope is that with this book I am able to inspire other young chemists at the beginning of their career, and perhaps persuade more experienced scientists that the statistical approach to experimentation has a higher yield.

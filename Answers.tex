\chapter{Answers to Exercises}

\section{From Chapter 1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compare and contrast population statistics versus sample statistics.
	

	{\small \texttt{Population statistics involve data from the entire universe of a subject under study, and are denoted by Greek letters.  Sample statistics, on the other hand, involve a relatively small number of randomly selected samples from a pop\-u\-la\-tion. They are denoted by English letters and only infer characteristics of the population they represent.}}

	
	\item What does the term \textit{inferential statistics} mean?
	
	
	{\small \texttt{Inferential statistics are those that infer, or deduce from sample evidence. They are estimates of the true nature, or value of a population char\-ac\-ter\-is\-tic.}}

	
	\item What is the difference between location statistics and variation statistics?
	

	{\small \texttt{Location statistics describe the magnitude of a dimension, for example, as if on a number line. This would also relate to a two-dimensional parameter, such as x-y coordinates, with a desire to be ``on target'' as if in the center of a bulls-eye. Variation statistics describe how precise a measure has been, where closely associated locations have low variance and widely spread data have high variance, or error.}}

	
	\item How are location statistics and variation statistics related to accuracy and precision?  
	
	
	{\small \texttt{Accuracy denotes close proximity of an average value of multiple observations to a target value, or a location of desire.  Precision denotes re\-pea\-ta\-bil\-i\-ty and re\-pro\-duc\-i\-bil\-i\-ty such that each time a measurement is taken very similar location results are observed in close proximity as a group as opposed to being widely scattered.} }
	
\end{enumerate}


\section{From Chapter 2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe a work environment from your past experiences in which data were collected, some analysis done, and results reported.  Specify how the data were reported, number of samples evaluated, calculations performed, etc.
	

	{\small \texttt{An example in a typical laboratory environment might be taking measurements of mass on an analytical lab balance. Typically multiple samples are tested, perhaps three to five samples. Typically the analyst reports an average (mean) value of the individual observations by summing the numerical results and dividing by the number of samples.}}

	\item What is a \textit{confidence interval}?
	

	{\small \texttt{A confidence interval is a range of values that encompasses a mean value of measurements. The range reported relates to a specific level of confidence, e.g. 95\% confidence. Different confidence levels correspond to different ranges.  For example the range of a 99\% confidence interval is wider than the 95\% interval for the same data.}}

	
	\item How does one find the correct value for $ t $ in a table of the Student's t distribution (see Appendix \ref{AppendixA})?
	

	{\small \texttt{To find the appropriate table value, the analyst must first have determined the degrees of freedom available based on sample size. For example if evaluating a set of five observations, the degrees of freedom would be N-1, or 4 degrees of freedom. The second parameter needed is the desired confidence level. Often this is 95\%, but any level of confidence may be chosen.  Once these two parameters are known, the table is used to obtain the Student's t statistic.}}

	
	\item When reporting a result with 95\% confidence, what is the chance that this statement is wrong?
	

	{\small \texttt{The probability that a result reported with 95\% confidence is wrong, is simply 100\% - 95\% = 5\% chance of being wrong. While this is entirely possible, it is unlikely at such a low value.}}

\end{enumerate}

\section{From Chapter 3}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Are these samples the same or are they different?
